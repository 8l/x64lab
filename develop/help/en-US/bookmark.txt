 Bookmarks

  Bookmarks enable fast access to references in your textual documents.
  in a near future i will implement them on binary files too.
  once you set a bookmark on a line in you source code, information
  will be read again from x64lab when reopening that source file.
  information for each textual document will be stored in the [tmp]
  directory of x64lab, in a TOP file format.

  you can find an instructional videoclip+music at
  http://youtu.be/M8GYXjeZkjc
  
  i have limited this capability to 65535 bookmarks for each document.
  if you dont add any bookmark in a source file, no information will be stored
  about it.
  
 - How to add a bookmark.

   while reading text files, user can add bookmarks simply clicking 
   on the left margin, left to the line number. a brown circular hotspot
   appears there. the bookmark is set and listed in the "Open documents"
   window, the lower list, indicating the line in the document and 
   eventual text at that line.

   clicking again on the brown hotspot on the left margin will remove
   the bookmark. it works essentially as a toggle.

 - How to access bookmarked documents.

   user can access bookmarked documents from the "Open documents"
   window, the lower list. open the target textual file; after clicking 
   on one of the (eventually saved) items, editor will show that line 
   in the source document.
