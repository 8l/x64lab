
 x64lab
 Commands and commandlines

 from the 1.0.47 version of x64lab it is possible to execute commands
 and redirect the output of them to the Console window.
 this is a real boost to your time/development. that mad clicking, you always
 forcedly liked, has been practically eliminated. i applied this successful idea
 already in my old 32bit ide. then i revised and improved it over the two
 Ã¼ast years.

 to configure your own commands open the file [config\command.utf8]
 you will find there some items of preconfigured commands. 
 this is an example, you can set there all types of command/commandlines 
 you need.

 <:"fasm <f>"
 <:"<f>"
 =:"notepad.exe <f>"
 >:"/K fasm <f>"
 ?:"dir *.asm"

 there are 4 modes to execute commandlines and some symbols
 matching the item in the workspace. if you right click in your workspace
 on an item "main.asm" residing in the directory [C:\mydir]
 the following symbols apply to that item:

  SYMBOLS   MEANING     EXPANSION
  ---------------------------------
   <d>       drive         C:
 	 <e>     extension      asm
 	 <f>    filename.ext  main.asm
 	 <n>      filename      main
 	 <p>       path       C:\mydir
  ---------------------------------

 1) MODE REDIRECT to console for items beginning with "<"
    example: right clicking on "main.asm" and executing
    <:"fasm <f>"
    all standard outputs will be redirected to the console
    of x64lab. the redirection always prepends "cmd /C" to the 
    command. the command results to be executed as 
    "cmd /C "fasm main.asm"

 2) MODE AS IS for items beginning with "="  example: 
    right clicking on "main.asm" and executing the command
    =:"notepad.exe <f>"
    it will be executed as it is without prepending anything.
    the command results to be launched as 
    "notepad.exe main.asm"
    this is a simple spawning of the command in the directory where
    the item choosen from the workspaces resides [C:\mydir]

 3) MODE SHELL for items beginning with ">" example
    >:"/K fasm <f>"
    right clicking on "main.asm" and executing the command
    a console shell opens, execute the command as
    "cmd /K fasm main.asm", and stay open (thanks to the /K arg 
    passed to cmd interpreter)

 4) MODE UNICODE REDIRECT for items begginning with "?" example
    ?:"dir *.asm". essentially as the 1) REDIRECT but only unicode.
    the command results to be executed as "cmd /U /C dir *.asm"

    the last executed command on an item in the workspace will be kept
    in memory. it may be executed again, if you have assigned a keyaccel
    shortcut to the "Execute command" menu item. (see keybinding hel file)
    by default it is assigned to F3.


    if you modify the file [config\command.utf8] to apply your own
    command items be sure to reload the command choosing
    "Reload commands" from the "Configure" main menu of x64lab.

 note: 
  - after reloading all last saved command will be discarded.
  - to escape the "<" and ">" symbols simply double it. example

    <:"dir <d> >> tempfile.txt"
    wiil start a command in which outputs will be redirected to 
    tempfile.txt (overriding the "<" of the mode 1)
