 Configure

 x64lab may be configured in several ways. at the moment i write
 we are in a growing phase. lot of flags and settings even when
 available, will not be read or written back in configuration files.
 this is because i am mainly concentrated on design.

 this document will cover the file [config\config.utf8] that gets
 modified, read and written back.
 configuration files ending in .utf8 are utf-8 text formatted
 documents. they contains TOP datas.

 TOP stays for Text-Object-Parsed documents.
 the [config\config.utf8] has a TOP structure. let examine it:

  lines starting with ; 20,21,22,23 are comments

  line 33, cons enable configuration for the "Console" window.
   an object in () follows. descriptions and items in the object
   relates to the console settings.

  line 34, set the backcolor, white in the case

  line 35, creates and sets an application environment variable "include".
   that environment variable is known at an application
   run-time level. the value of it corresponds to "E:\fasm\include".
   exiting from x64lab, that variable will be automatically
   unset by the OS. but it remains there if you start a
   console shell using the menu "Open console here" in x64lab
   from the path menu and then, exiting x64lab, you mantain that console open
   because you need it for other work.

  line 36, sets the path variable, incrementing it after expansion.
   you can get the same result after typing the following command in a consol shell:
   path=%path%;E:\fasm

  the "env" setting may unset previously defined variable.
  using a null string "" as value. example

  env:"path",""

  this will discard the value of "path" at application run-time level.
  exiting application, OS will give back you the value of it.

  the "env" setting is cumulative. example without expansion:
  having the following three lines

  env:"spezi","0"
  env:"pepsi","2"
  env:"spezi","1"
  
  x64lab will attribute the variable "spezi" the value "1" finally.
