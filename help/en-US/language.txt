 Language

 - Activating a Language pack.

    In the menu [Configure|Language] developers can select one of the available
    languages for x64lab. the checkmarked one is the current language.
    once clicking on a different language application will reload all informations
    from one of the local files in [lang\*.bin] without needing a restart.
    by default x64lab starts with the [lang\en-US.bin] pack.

 
 - Downloading new languages.

    x64lab can check online if new or updates language are available. it is done
    through clicking on the menuitem [Configure|Update|Language update (script)].
    a script will be launched and user will be prompted to download one of the
    available binary packs.
    the language script is a vbscript file [tool\update.wsf]
    once the language pack has been downloaded (overwriting the existing one eventually),
    activate it choosing the menuitem from [Configure|Language].
